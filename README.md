This project implements a GSM-based geolocation system that, upon receiving either a push-button input or a serial command, determines its approximate position without relying on GPS. Instead, it gathers signal measurements from nearby cellular base stations via a SIM800L module, relays those measurements through an ESP32 microcontroller, and then submits them to Googleâ€™s Geolocation API. The API returns latitude and longitude estimates based on the reported cell-tower identifiers and signal strengths. Below you can see photographs of the individual components and the fully assembled prototype in operation.
