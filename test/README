 * @brief Serial bridge between a PC and SIM800L GSM module using ESP32.
 *
 * This program sets up a serial bridge between a PC (via the main Serial port)
 * and a SIM800L GSM module (via SoftwareSerial). It allows the user to send AT
 * commands from the PC to the SIM800L and receive responses, filtering out
 * non-printable characters from the SIM800L output.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * This sketch is designed to **test and validate connectivity** between an ESP32
 * board and a SIM800L GSM module. By acting as a transparent communication bridge,
 * it helps ensure that the module is powered, properly wired, and responsive to
 * AT commands sent via the serial monitor on your PC.
 *
 * Pin Definitions:
 * - MODEM_RX: GPIO pin connected to SIM800L TX (default: 16)
 * - MODEM_TX: GPIO pin connected to SIM800L RX (default: 17)
 *
 * Baud Rates:
 * - MODEM_BAUD: Baud rate for SIM800L communication (default: 9600)
 * - PC_BAUD: Baud rate for PC serial communication (default: 115200)
 *
 * Functionality:
 * - Forwards all data from the PC Serial to the SIM800L.
 * - Forwards only printable ASCII characters and common control characters
 *   (CR, LF) from the SIM800L to the PC Serial, filtering out garbage data.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Connect the ESP32 to the PC via USB.
 * 2. Connect the SIM800L module to the specified RX/TX pins.
 * 3. Power the SIM800L module appropriately (recommended: 3.7Vâ€“4.2V with sufficient current).
 * 4. Open a serial monitor at 115200 baud and send AT commands.
 * 5. Observe readable responses from the SIM800L module.
